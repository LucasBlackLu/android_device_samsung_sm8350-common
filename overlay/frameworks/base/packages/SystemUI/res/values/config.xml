    <!-- Doze: does this device support STATE_DOZE?

    <!-- Doze: does this device support STATE_DOZE_SUSPEND?
        Display state: The display is dozing in a suspended low power state;
        it is still on but the CPU is not updating it. This may be used in
        one of two ways: to show static system-provided content while the
        device is non-interactive, or to allow a "Sidekick" compute
        resource to update the display. For this reason, the CPU must not
        control the display in this mode. -->
